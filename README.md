# WidgetManagementSystem

# About
Widget Management System is a Project that I completed in CSCI 313 - Data Structures

This project aims to emulate a inventory management system that processes widgets from a instruction file and displays the results of each instruction to an output file.

This project utilizes OOP principles and a custom stack and queue classes are utilized to implement the inventory and waitlist.

# How To Use
* The user inputs a .txt file including transaction instructions in the format of <Buy/Sell> <Quantity> <Cost>.
